# Data structure and algorithm

This is a project of my persuit to learn DSA in detail. I'll try to put as much content and code as possible to improve myself in this core area.

### Prerequisites

You just need to install Anaconda so that we can code in python3. Later on we will explore other programming languages as well for DSA.

## Reference Books-

**Data Structures and Algorithms in Python Paperback â€“ 2016
